# webpack-basics

a template for making a bare-bones webpack react app. 

`npm i` to install node dependencies

`npm run dev` to build dev dist

`npm start` to serve the app

### #TODO
- production webpack config
- customize dev server (port and host) - put in an env file??
- make scripts to serve it with prod and dev configs
- integrate `cross-env`

### research
- how to customize the names of the chuncks that are served (`optimization.splitChunks`)/does it matter?
